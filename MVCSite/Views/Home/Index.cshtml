                                <strong>I met my first personal computer.</strong> Shortly after my school got
                                a TRS-80, some of us were invited to attend a coding camp hosted by the US Army
                                at Fort Leavenworth. That experience, along with the encouragement of my
                                teachers, piqued my interest in programming.

                                support side of the industry. I began a 28-year career of training the people
                                who keep systems and networks running. Though my focus changed toward
                                administrative scripting, I never stopped coding. In those early days, I was
                                writing some very sophisticated (and hundreds-of-lines long) DOS batch files. I
                                also began learning HTML and building for the nascent World Wide Web.

                                when I worked with a team of like-minded high schoolers turning out platformers
                                and text adventures for the Apple II. Or writing hacking tools for my friends
                                and their Commodore 64s. I just get a kick out of programming.

                <h1>There and Back Again</h1>
                <p>
                    Like many kids of the eighties, I got my start with personal computers programming the
                    early eight-bit micros. It's what you had to do; most computers didn't come with a large
                    selection of ready-made software. If you wanted to really <em>use</em> your computer, you
                    had to learn to <em>program</em> your computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That wasn't a hardship. Many of us found that we had an aptitude for programming and
                    enjoyed solving the puzzles new projects presented. We wanted to learn and showcase new
                    skills, making games, music, and business software, and having fun in the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, we can never tell how things will turn out. One path leads to another, and we
                    often find our way back with great difficulty, or not at all. In the words of Robert Frost:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br />
                    Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br />
                    I doubted if I should ever come back.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    However, after twenty-eight years training IT professionals, I've decided to dust off the
                    old skills, learn some new ones, and get back to the road not taken. It's been a while, and
                    things have changed a bit in the four decades since I got my first computer. But I feel
                    almost like I'm returning to an old homestead and familiar friends. Let's see what the next
                    few decades will bring.
